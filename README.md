# Recursion
This thread is dedicated to solving recursion problems.

Recursion is an essential concept in computer science that involves a function calling itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case or a termination condition. Understanding recursion is crucial because it allows you to solve complex problems that are difficult to solve iteratively or with simple loops.

Recursion is particularly useful in solving problems that exhibit a "divide-and-conquer" nature, where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler subproblems that can be solved recursively. This approach is often used in many algorithms, such as quicksort and binary search, which are widely used in computer science.

Another reason recursion is essential is that it can help you write cleaner, more concise code. Instead of writing multiple loops or conditional statements to solve a problem, you can write a single recursive function that can handle different cases and conditions.

However, it's important to note that recursion can be computationally expensive and can lead to issues like stack overflow if not implemented correctly. Therefore, it's important to understand the fundamentals of recursion and when it's appropriate to use it.

All of the problems posted here, have been explained in my [website](aevmorfop.co.uk) as well with a more in depth explanation of the topic.
